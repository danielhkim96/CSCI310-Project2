Our first goal is to make sure JUnit testing is correctly implemented and covers all of the new requirements we have implemented so far. JUnit testing was what ultimately failed us during our second development cycle: Because it wasn’t implemented correctly, we were unable to demonstrate most of the functionality we implemented for Sprint 2. That makes this our first priority for our final sprint. Next, we plan to implement the additional functionality our stakeholder outlined in our sprint 2 meeting. Specifically, he made suggestions for how we format our pagination and how to access the grocery list. We also plan to implement requirement 7 and finish implementing requirement 5. Because we didn’t get as much feedback as we were hoping for during the second cycle, we’re going to spend the third cycle making sure that the functionality we do implement is robust and versatile. We’re also going to expand on the functionality already implemented in order to ensure those features are robust as well.
