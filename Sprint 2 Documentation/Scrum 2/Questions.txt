What have you accomplished since the last meeting?
Samuel He: Database JUnit tests are drafted

Daniel Kim: Discovered the error: “This API Project is not authorized to use this API”

Yvette Lopez: Made sure grocery list API passess all the black-box tests. Login functionality and pagination tests are drafted, though not fully implemented.

Xubo Zhu: Researched Pagination.  


Are there any obstacles in the way of meeting your goal?
Samuel He: None

Daniel Kim: Having trouble finding documentation on why the project suddenly lost its authorization to use the API and how to fix it.

Yvette Lopez: None

Xubo Zhu: Confused in finding the best way to implement the pagination, most online tutorials deal with static pagination, not dynamic ones. 


What will you accomplish before the next meeting?
Samuel He: Implement the database into the back-end

Daniel Kim: Fix the API error

Yvette Lopez: Finish implementing login-functionality tests.

Xubo Zhu: Keep on researching and implementing pagination.
