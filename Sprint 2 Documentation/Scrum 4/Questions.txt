What have you accomplished since the last meeting?
Samuel He: Finished integrating database with JUnit tests. Drafted white-box tests for reordering the lists.

Daniel Kim: Finished implementation of login and signup.

Yvette Lopez: Finished drafting the black-box tests for reordering the lists 

Xubo Zhu: Managed to implement an online framework of pagination using bootstrap and solodev. But when the pagination bar show up on screen, the drop-down menu fails to show up, probably due to the conflicts in the imported javascript libraries.


Are there any obstacles in the way of meeting your goal?
Samuel He: Database schema was incompatible with some backend functions. Schema was changed.

Daniel Kim: Not very experienced with frontend.

Yvette Lopez: Not too familiar with the website code given that my main tasks so far have been testing.

Xubo Zhu: Conflicts in the imported javascript libraries to cause that the pagination framework fails to work along with our already imported functions. 


What will you accomplish before the next meeting?
Samuel He: Finish integrating database with backend. Work on login functionality. 

Daniel Kim: Get started on making the UI look modern and attractive.

Yvette Lopez: Modify existing tests to make sure the UI changes don’t screw with any black box testing. Research how to reorder the lists.

Xubo Zhu: Will have to figure out how to resolve the conflicts in the libraries or do the implementation on our own without using online frameworks (may be not as beautiful).
