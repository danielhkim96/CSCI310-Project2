Are there any obstacles in the way of meeting your goal?
The previous build had some errors in the API that prevented us from demoing it. Our goal is to fix those issues first.

What will you accomplish before the next meeting?
Samuel He:  Finish integrating database with JUnit tests.

Daniel Kim: Fix the bug in restaurant search.

Yvette Lopez: Double check that the grocery lists API passess all black-box tests. Begin drafting the tests for login functionality and pagination.

Xubo Zhu: Look into what happened with the Google Places API, try to fix what went wrong in the Demo 1, research ways to implement pagination.
